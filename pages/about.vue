Hi, thanks for visiting. This is a nuxt3 + vuetify + tailwind project. Database is a JSON file earlier it was a PSQL db ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (good decison imo).
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
I created this in my second year of engineering using vue2 + vuetify and then migrated it to the current stack in final year. <br>
I gave my JEE in year 2019 and it didn't go well. I was very upset but almost 4 year later I think I was overreacting. 
No doubt an important exam but it is idiotic to tie your self worth to JEE score. 
Life after JEE is bit more open ended and there will be more opportunities that will intrest you.  <br>
I won't offer any advice, but I'm confident that no matter the outcome, you'll take pride in the effort you put into preparing for JEE. And remember, life after the exam will be full of interesting opportunities that you may not even be aware of yet
<br/>
<br/>
Pls send errors ,suggestion at jeecollegepredictor[at]gmail.com and all the best for your exam and beyond.
